if you want to download aflow icsd data by self as I did (not recomended, it will take a bit long time), you can install the aflow by rosenbrockc ( https://github.com/rosenbrockc/aflow ) and run the python_restart.py file on linux.
the aflow_icsd.zip file is the data I download from aflow database and used in model training.
