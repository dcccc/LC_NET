if you want to run the model, unzip the dataset.zip file, put the atom_neighbors_data, neighbors_distan_data, structure_atom_num_data and label_of_qe here, then run the Egap_ANN.py. after the model is trained, the mae and mse of train set and test set will be written in result file, and the model in every epoch also saved. read the model source code for all detials.

before run the model, the pytorch, numpy are should be installed.

run the E_gap_error.py to get Egap error, read the source for all details.

as the model is very simple, so I think you will have no much difficulty in understanding.
